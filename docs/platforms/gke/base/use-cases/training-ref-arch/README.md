This document outlines the reference architecture for deploying and managing
training workloads, particularly on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). It serves as
a foundational guide for building robust and scalable training solutions. This
implementation is an extension of the
[GKE Base Platform](/docs/platforms/gke/base/README.md) tailored for training
workloads.

Refer to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section below for instructions
on setting up the infrastructure described in this document.

## Getting Started

A practical guide to setting up the infrastructure as described can be found in
the
[Training reference implementation](/platforms/gke/base/use-cases/training-ref-arch/terraform/README.md)

This reference architecture is designed to support various training patterns.
Some example patterns provided are:

- [Model Fine Tuning](/docs/platforms/gke/base/use-cases/training-ref-arch/model-fine-tuning/README.md)

Further use cases and patterns can be built upon this foundational architecture.
