      "text_0": "Of course. Here are three distinct, highly detailed prompts you can use directly. They are designed to produce very different artistic styles. Below them, you'll find a \"Build-Your-Own\" template so you can create your own with the same level of detail.\n\n---\n\n### **Option 1: Cinematic Neo-Noir Detective**\n\nThis prompt aims for a photorealistic, moody, and cinematic image.\n\n**Prompt:**\n`cinematic film still of a grizzled private detective in his late 40s, sharp jawline, tired but determined eyes, 3-day stubble. He stands on a rain-slicked neo-noir city street at midnight, steam rising from a manhole cover beside him. He wears a classic, heavy wool trench coat, collar turned up against the wind, raindrops clinging to the fabric. The scene is illuminated by the harsh, electric blue and magenta glow of towering holographic advertisements, casting long, dramatic chiaroscuro shadows. Medium shot, he looks slightly off-camera with a thoughtful, weary expression. Photorealistic, hyper-detailed, 8k, UHD, Unreal Engine 5 render, volumetric lighting, cinematic color grading, masterpiece.`\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Ethereal Fantasy Scholar**\n\nThis prompt aims for a painterly, high-fantasy style with soft, magical lighting.\n\n**Prompt:**\n`Digital painting of an elderly, wise male scholar with a long, flowing white beard and kind, crinkling eyes. He is in a sun-drenched, ancient library filled with towering, carved-oak bookshelves and floating, gently glowing magical orbs. He is looking up from a massive, leather-bound tome on a lectern, a gentle smile on his face as a single, perfect sunbeam (god rays) illuminates the dust motes dancing in the air around him. He wears simple, elegant linen robes of a sage. The style is a blend of fantasy concept art by Alan Lee and the rich textures of a classic oil painting. Warm, golden hour lighting, epic, detailed, masterpiece, trending on Artstation.`\n\n---\n\n### **Option 3: Expressive Modern Portrait**\n\nThis prompt aims for a raw, emotional, and textured artistic portrait, focusing on brushwork and feeling over realism.\n\n**Prompt:**\n`An expressive, impasto oil painting portrait of a young man in his early 20s. Head and shoulders, intimate close-up. He has an introspective and melancholic expression, with messy, windswept dark hair falling across his forehead. The lighting is a single, soft source from the side, creating a dramatic play of light and shadow (chiaroscuro). The background is an abstract, textured canvas of deep indigo and burnt sienna. Focus on the raw emotion and the thick, visible brushstrokes and palette knife textures on the canvas. Muted, emotional color palette. In the style of Jeremy Mann and Lucian Freud. Fine art, masterpiece, highly textured.`\n\n---\n\n### **Build-Your-Own Detailed Prompt Template**\n\nUse this template to construct your own prompts.
